    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
  I completed my M.A. thesis titled "<em>The Role of Bureaucratic Purges in Shaping Public Service Provision</em>" 
  in the Political Science department at Sabancı University, advised by Assist. Prof. Fatih Serkant Adıgüzel.

      "This thesis examines the impact of bureaucratic purges on public service provision, focusing on the Turkish 
      government's dismissal of nearly 130,000 public employees between 2016 and 2018 following a failed coup 
      attempt. Leveraging novel administrative data on each dismissed state employee, it begins with an analysis of 
      the spatial and administrative distribution of the dismissals. The research primarily moves beyond canonical 
      approaches that view purges as power consolidation through elite purges, and instead captures the broader 
      societal impacts by assessing changes in the state's service delivery capacity post-purge. Using a 
      difference-in-differences model to analyze how varying magnitudes of dismissals affect public teachers on 
      students' standardized test performance, findings reveal a decrease in student performance at the district 
      level, while similar analyses for police dismissals do not indicate crime rate changes. Overall, this study 
      seeks higher external validity by moving beyond limited samples and inherent methodological constraints in 
      prior work on bureaucratic capacity's impact on public services."
