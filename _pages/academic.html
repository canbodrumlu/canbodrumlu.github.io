    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      In 2024, I completed my M.A. thesis titled "<em>The Role of Bureaucratic Purges in Shaping Public Service Provision</em>" 
      in the Political Science department at Sabancƒ± University, advised by Assist. Prof. Fatih Serkant Adiguzel.

          This thesis examines the impact of bureaucratic purges on public service provision, focusing on the Turkish 
          government's dismissal of nearly 130,000 public employees between 2016 and 2018 following a failed coup 
          attempt. Leveraging novel administrative data on each dismissed state employee, it begins with an analysis of 
          the spatial and administrative distribution of the dismissals. The research primarily moves beyond canonical 
          approaches that view purges as power consolidation through elite purges, and instead captures the broader 
          societal impacts by assessing changes in the state's service delivery capacity post-purge. Using a 
          difference-in-differences model to analyze how varying magnitudes of dismissals affect public teachers on 
          students' standardized test performance, findings reveal a decrease in student performance at the district 
          level, while similar analyses for police dismissals do not indicate crime rate changes. Overall, this study 
          seeks higher external validity by moving beyond limited samples and inherent methodological constraints in 
          prior work on bureaucratic capacity's impact on public services.

      Political elites in authoritarian regimes often resort to dramatic bureaucratic purges
      as a strategy to tighten their grip on power. Yet, despite their growing global
      frequency, the far-reaching social consequences of such sweeping dismissals remain
      poorly understood. This study examines the impact of bureaucratic purges on service
      delivery by analyzing mass public employee dismissals in Turkey following the 2016
      coup attempt. Leveraging variation in teachers‚Äô dismissals across administrative
      units as an exogenous shock, it aims to estimate the effect of the purge on student
      performance in high school entrance exams. The results show a significant decline
      in exam scores following teacher dismissals. By bridging research on bureaucratic
      turnover, state capacity, and education outcomes, this study offers insight into how
      politically motivated interventions can undermine public service provision.

      <strong>Behind the Desk: What Becomes of Bureaucrats Who Plan Mass Violence?</strong><br>

          While the role of bureaucrats in planning and orchestrating state-sanctioned violence is well-studied, less 
          attention has been paid to their fates after a regime change. What becomes of ‚Äúdesk murderers,‚Äù the bureaucrats 
          who orchestrated mass violence but were not its public face, once the regime that enabled their actions collapses? 
          This study argues that their expertise in organizing mass violence can render them valuable to successor regimes 
          engaged in violent nation-building projects. Drawing on archival sources, I trace the careers of Ottoman bureaucrats 
          involved in the 1915 Armenian Genocide under the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), examining their trajectories 
          within the Turkish Republic established in 1923, which had officially repudiated the CUP. I argue that they had a 
          higher propensity to be recruited into the new regime to support the nation-building process targeting ‚Äúremaining‚Äù 
          minorities. These findings can shed light on the continuity of state violence and the afterlives of perpetrators.
