Hi! My name is Can (/ˈd͡ʒan/), and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. I was born and raised in Turkey and spent seven years in Istanbul studying political science. I received my M.A. from Sabanci University (2024) and B.A. from Bogazici University (2022) there.

I am primarily interested in comparative politics, with a specific focus on political economy and quantitative methods. My research focuses on understanding bureaucracy and its role in state capacity. I wrote my master’s thesis on the impact of bureaucratic purges on public service provision, and I really enjoy playing with administrative data.
