Hi! My name is Can, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">(/ˈd͡ʒan/)</a>, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the <a href="https://www.polisci.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">University of Washington</a>, Seattle. I was born and raised in Turkey and spent seven years in Istanbul studying political science. I received my M.A. from Sabanci University (2024) and B.A. from Bogazici University (2022) there.

I am primarily interested in comparative politics, with a specific focus on political economy and quantitative methods. My research focuses on understanding bureaucracy and its role in state capacity. I have recently been focusing on the impact of bureaucratic purges on public service provision, and I really enjoy playing with administrative data.
